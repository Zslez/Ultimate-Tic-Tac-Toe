# Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe

Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe game coded in C++, with a MiniMax algorithm computer opponent that is currently able to defeat the Medium difficulty of the AI on [this website](https://michaelxing.com/UltimateTTT/v3/).

In the `game` folder there is also a `game 3x3.h` file, that I used to first try the MiniMax algorithm on the simpler standard version of Tic-Tac-Toe.

## Used Libraries

- `SDL2`
- `SDL_image`
- `SDL_ttf`

## To-Do List

- [ ] allow the player to choose whether to play as X or O
- [ ] improve the MiniMax algorithm in general, allowing it to perform deeper searches
- [ ] improve the evaluation algorithm, as for now it is quite basic
